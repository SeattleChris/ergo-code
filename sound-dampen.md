# Sound Dampening

[resource](https://blog.wooting.nl/sound-dampen-your-mechanical-keyboard-noises/)

Most common approach seems to be O-rings (from braces) but also soft pads, GMK switch clip, key cap material & switch mounting, and awareness of table/surface & general board construction.

## O-Rings

Most common are 40A-L, 40A-R, and 50A-L. This classification represents [hardness]A-[thickness]. A higher hardness number is harder and more resistant to indentation. For thickness, 'R' is twice as thick as 'L'. The thickness shortens the travel distance, with 'L' taking off about 0.2mm, and 'R' removing 0.4mm (in theory).

Sizes I've seen for sale:

- 40A
- 50A
- 70A
- 80A
- 90A

## Soft Pads

A less tedious setup (if your keyboard has a standard shape) is to put this foam cloth as a landing pad for the switch caps. Common version of this has a similiar effect as the 50A-R o-rings.

## GMK Switch Clip

Basically clips on to each switch and creates individual soft pad for each key. https://www.gmk-electronic-design.de/en

## Key Cap & Mounting Differences

PBT key caps will generally sound more thumpy, while ABS will sound more clicky. For additional durability and quality reasons PBT are the more preffered key caps. Thickness of the key cap (such as double-shot printing ABS being thicker than other options) will make it sound different.

Plate mounted key switches are held in place and will be louder than PCB mounted switches. PCB mounted switches will flex a bit and reduce sound vibrations.

## Other Sound Considerations

If your keyboard is on a wood or glass table, it will generally resonate louder. Putting a desk/mouse pad underneath your keyboard can quit this down. The physical structure of your keyboard, and other build details, can cause more or less noise depending on the flex, hardness, and resonance of how it is built.
