# Key Caps

## Key Shape

Cylindrical: The pad where your finger touchs has scoop left to right, but front to back has no scoop.

Spherical: Like a recessed ball where your fingertip touches the key. Scoops both left to right and front to back.

## Key Profile

This is about the height of the key, and possibly the slope of the key cap (top and bottom are at different heights). For height: 'OEM' / Filco are generally the tallest. Signature Plastics are medium height. Cherry Corp keys are a short height.

When a keyboard has rows of keys at different heights the rows will be numbered or otherwise labeled. Despite the ISO/IEC 9995-1 is a definition of how the keyboard rows should be labeled, this is rarely used and there is not an absolute consistency in how companies number their rows. The following is perhaps the most common (with WASD company going the opposite order). The home row (C by ISO) is generally labled as R3 (row 3). The row above it (the QWERTY row, or D by ISO) is R2 (row 2). The two rows below the home row are typically the same key height (in ISO the would be B, or if different heights then the bottom is A in ISO) and labeled R4 (row 4). The one to two top rows (the numbers and function key rows, and E in ISO) are usually the same height and labeled R1. For ISO, if any rows above alphanumeric are a unique height their labels will start with K and continue alphabetically if additional row height patterns are defined, while rows below the spacebar row (row A if different than the lowest alphanumeric which is row B) will be labeled starting with Z and progressing backwards alphabetically if more defined rows are needed.

Flat: Probably not wanted for most keys. level key height amongst rows, possibly a little slope to the key tops. More similiar to rubber dome. Think chicklet keyboards. Some familiy styles: LP (-1deg or maybe flat tops), DSA (scooped key caps, 0deg slope, Height 0.291), KT (8deg slope on all keys with top lower than the bottom). Also, a perhaps non-standard version labeled G20 (on PimpMyKeyboard, flat top with larger surface with perhaps a 3deg slope).

Sculptered Profile: Each row has a different height. The key cap itself may have a slope, such that the bottom and the top of the key are at different heights. There are a few sculpted families:

- SA: Top row -13deg, R2 -7deg, R3 home row is 0deg, R4 is 7deg, bottom is 0deg. Height 0.462
- SS: Top row -1deg, R2 5deg, R3 home 12deg, R4 19deg, bottom 12deg
- DSS: Top row is -1deg, R2 is 3deg, R3 Home is 8deg, R4 is 16deg, Bottom is 8deg. Height 0.285
- DCS: Top -6deg, R1 -1deg, r2 3deg, R3 home 7deg, R4 and bottom 16deg. Height 0.248

DCS is what Signature Plastics make, but others may be a modified DCS profile.

## Key Thickness

How thick the walls of the key are.

## Key Spacing & Size

19mm x 19mm spacing of the keys (from center of key to center of next key) has been shown to be good ergonomically for the main keys. The standard size for the key itself is about 18mm, and this is referred to as 1x spacing.

A typical keyboard main section is 15x key units wide. The outside edge keys, and the bottom row, frequently have the following relative sizes (with 1x being the standard key size).

- Tab: 1.5x
- Caps Lock: 1.75x
- L-Shift: 2.25x
- Backspace: 2x
- '| \' key: 1.5x
- Enter: 2.25x
- R-Shift: 2.75x
- Alt, Ctrl, Super/Window, Menu: 1.25x each
- Spacebar: 6.25x

## Stabilizers

This is for very large keys to keep them from feeling like they tip over or feel unstable. This is especially for the spacebar key, but perhaps the other 2x or larger keys? Classic and generic is to have a wire stablizer. Cherry Corp stablizers are basically switches without the springs, some people think they are mushy. Costar stabilizers have both a wire and inserts/pegs to connect them into the side of the key cap, some people think they are fiddly.

## Print Technique

Blank: No legends printed

2-Shot: Very long life and durable, and generally a high contrast. Legend graphic is molded to stick out of the plastic layer it is on. Another plastic layer mold has a void to allow the legend to show throw but makes it flush and smooth for the key cap top.

Sublimated: Allows for multiple colors with decent durability. A dry ink diffuses and penetrates the key cap surface by about 0.001 inches.

Pad-Printed: Can rub off after a while. Legends are printed with a two-part epoxy ink, then clear coated afterwards.

Laser-etched: Using a laser to cut away some plastic and usually fill it in with ink to better see it.

## Backlight

Certain choices need to be made to allow for backlight key caps. More details TBD.

## Material of Key Cap

PS, PC, PVC - are common inexpensive plastics.

ABS - Better than the cheapo plastics, slightly softer but resistant to breakage.

PBT - Typical high quality plastic, better than ABS.

POM - Expensive and less commonly used, also known by brand name Delrin. Abrasion-restant, low-friction material. If you wanted no expense spared then perhaps go for POM, but PBT is probably a good high-end alternative.
