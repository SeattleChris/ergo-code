# Key Switches

## Common Models w/ Characterisitcs

Due to my interests, this is mostly focused on Tactile type switches. So less focus on clicky and linear. However, it is good to know some of these other general key switches.

## Type

Linear Switches - Desired by gamers, not likely typists.No tactile bump at actuation. Fairly silent travel, but bottoms out for impact noise which can be reduced by O-rings.

Tactile Switches - tactile bump that gives a feeling of resistance at the point of actuation. The switch itself is low noise, but clicky varients will omit a click sound.

Clicky Switches - tactile resistance and audible click. Basically a varient on a Tactile switch.

Buckling Spring - tactile feedback when the spring buckles and hits the wall it is inside. This is also when it pushes down the hammer to actuate the key press.

Topre - halfway between membrane and normal mechanical. Actuate at 5g (VERY light touch), quit.

Dome Membrane - Not desired, but cheap.

Scissor-switch - a type of dome membrane switch, popular with laptop keyboards. Key travel of 1-2.5mm, noiser than dome membrane, with actuation force around 65-85g (though as high as 100g). Generally feel more tactile and crisp compared to dome membrane.

Flat-Panel Membrane - Typically used for microwaves, not keyboards. Like the dome membrane except no real key travel. No one wants this as a keyboard.

Conductive Rubber - can be similiar feel to membrane, but easier to fix "in field".

## Brands

Cherry - Gold standard in mechanical switches (linear, tactile, clicky).
Topre - see Topre type.
Greetech and Kailh - Cherry imitation.

## Key Characterisitcs

Key Travel Distance: Membrane typically is 3.5-4.0mm, or short down to 2.5mm
Noise Level: Membrane are quiter than anything else.
Durability: 1 million to 10 million, but other parts can wear out quicker.
Key Activation Force: membrane tends to be in the 60-80 grams range.
Tactility ('Feel'): membrane keys feel mushy.

## Typical Key Switch Sizes

|Param|Value  |Description|
|L    |18 mm  |Length|
|W    |18 mm  |Width|
|s    |30 mm  |Radius|
|p     |70° Front tilt in degrees|
|q     |80° Left and Right tilt value in degrees|
|HB     9 mm  Maximm height at the back|
|HF     9.3 mm  Maximum height at the front|

## Sound Dampening

Most common approach seems to be O-rings (from braces) but also soft pads, GMK switch clip, awareness of table/surface and general board construction.

### O-Rings

Most common are 40A-L, 40A-R, and 50A-L. This classification represents [hardness]A-[thickness]. A higher hardness number is harder and more resistant to indentation. For thickness, 'R' is twice as thick as 'L'. The thickness shortens the travel distance, with 'L' taking off about 0.2mm, and 'R' removing 0.4mm (in theory).

### Soft Pads

A less tedious setup (if your keyboard has a standard shape) is to put this foam cloth as a landing pad for the switch caps. Common version of this has a similiar effect as the 50A-R o-rings.

### GMK Switch Clip

Basically clips on to each switch and creates individual soft pad for each key.

### Other Sound Considerations

If your keyboard is on a wood or glass table, it will generally resonate louder. Putting a desk/mouse pad underneath your keyboard can quit this down. The physical structure of your keyboard, and other build details, can cause more or less noise depending on the flex, hardness, and resonance of how it is built.
