# Attempts and Plans

## January 2020 Print Results

- Key switch holes can be slightly smaller
- This curvature for finger reach forward and back is a little too aggressive.
  - Some key caps may not fit
  - However, it is closer than one probably would guess.
- Maybe want the 'extra key' trigger button on the home column pointer finger.
  - Unsure if it can fit with the thumb section
- Top row value:
  - Less curve may help. Maybe just modified curve for top row?
  - Pointer finger seems pretty good (okay to take general adjustments)
  - Middle finger: behind the key switch does not have enough hollow space.
  - Ring finger: pretty good!
  - Pinkie home and bonus column: can not really reach top, but maybe more column shift
- Bonus Bottom "Trigger" row
  - Pointer home column could be nice, if it could fit
  - Middle, Ring, and Pinkie home - pretty good, as long as not a core frequent key
- Column Alignment:
  - Maybe ring pulled down a small amount - 25% of key size
  - Maybe pinkie pulled down more - 50% of key size
- Roll front to back: Maybe roll it even more, so more trigger pulling action instead of reach out action
  - 'Bonus row' probably should not go more than vertical
  - enough room for the thumb section to still fit?
  - Not a full row of roll back
  - Maybe 25% of key size?
- Reach Columns: Pointer finger is great, pinkie is less good
  - ? Remove pinkie bonus column?
  - Pinkie Bonus column-3: has home row, 1 down and 1 up.
  - Pinkie Bonus column-2: has home row, 1 down.
- Print error: need better cover on right bottom thumb section.
- Perhaps more space behind pinkie lastrow / bonus row key.
